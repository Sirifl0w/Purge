Purge
=====

An iOS 7 Multitasking tweak. Kill all apps in the app switcher via a long press on the app snapshots and app icons (as the 1.2betas).

Possible future additions may include:

- Fading of the app snapshots (similar to Auxo).

New additions - 

- Exclude now playing app when killing all apps if music is playing.
- Long hold on app icons to kill all apps.
- Preference panel with options to enable or disable 'auto dismiss switcher' and 'kill all alert' features.
- Cleaner code. Thanks @JonasGessner for some assistance - I am a busy man!
