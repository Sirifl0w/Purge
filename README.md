Purge
=====

An iOS 7 Multitasking tweak. Kill all apps in the app switcher via a long press on the app snapshots.

Possible future additions may include:

- Fading of the app snapshots (similar to Auxo).
- Filter apps with preference page.

Since I am running all my tweaks through the iOS simulator, if anyone wishes to test Purge on a jailbroken iPhone 4 running iOS 7 feel free to contact me via twitter (@sirifl0w). Head over to the 'debs' file for the latest packages.
